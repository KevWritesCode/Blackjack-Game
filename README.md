# Blackjack-Game
A simple blackjack game built using Python 3.x.

Technologies Used:

- Python 3.x

Description:

The Blackjack Game is a simple card game that allows players to play against the dealer. The game is implemented using Python 3.11.1 and uses a deck of cards to simulate the game.

Key Parts of the Code:

- deal_card function: This function takes a deck of cards and returns a card from the deck.
- calculate_hand function: This function takes a list of cards and returns the value of the hand.
- while loop: This loop allows the player to repeatedly hit or stand until their hand value is over 21 or they choose to stand.
- if-elif-else block: This block is used to handle the different possibilities in the game such as hitting, standing, and busting.

Design Decisions:

The design of the Blackjack Game was kept simple for ease of use. The user interface is minimal, consisting only of the instructions and prompts for the player to hit or stand. The player must try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, while the dealer must follow a strict set of rules for hitting and standing.

The choice to use a deck of cards was made because it provides a more realistic simulation of the game of blackjack. Additionally, this allows for the possibility of adding more features such as card counting in the future.

Reflection:

Working on the Blackjack Game was a great learning experience. I was able to apply my knowledge of Python to build a functional and user-friendly game. One of the challenges I faced was figuring out how to handle the different scenarios in the game, but I was able to overcome this by using if-elif-else blocks.

I learned that even simple games like this can be engaging and provide a good learning experience. Additionally, I learned the importance of considering the rules and logic of the game when designing the code.
